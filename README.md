# Welcome to zDark Hub
The Ultimate Single Player Cheat

zDark Hub is a single-player cheat tool that uses the MCData (Minecraft Datapack) API in combination with the MCExecutor script runner.

# How to Use:
To run it, simply use the following script:

    loadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerdola12-Dev/zDark/refs/heads/main/zDark.py")

# Notes:
If it doesn't work the first time, close and reopen it â€” this will allow it to install all required datapacks.

To uninstall the cheat from a world, go to your world folder and delete any folders related to zDark.

Enjoy your enhanced Minecraft experience!
